            <p>WAI standards allow accessibility for people with physical, cognitive, sensory, or mobility handicap to access web contents. The ability to access web contents in the world wide web had become vital for the everyday lives of people in modern times. Web contents access allow remote work in the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, registration for university and college programs, remote management of financial accounts, and online browsing for discounts of items in stores. Accessible features in webpages protected the rights of disabled people to access basic information and services that other people take for granted.  
            </p>
            <p>One of the accessibility standards that I implemented is the Accessible Name and Description Computation 1.1 which requires the clarification of the roles of web elements in a webpage so that assistive technologies can convert them to the proper format for accessibility purpose. The standard defines support that applies across multiple content technologies. This includes accessible name and description provided by general-purpose WAI-ARIA [WAI-ARIA] roles, states, and properties as well as features specific to individual content languages. The roles of each element are specified with the "role" attribute which helps describe the function of a tag so that an algorithm or artificial intelligence could know how to format the tag for the output of a given device. as a description of its role. This standard also provides assessibility to people with financial or technological handicap as they could buy or rent a less robust algorithm or artificial intelligence to format the webpage elements into a presentation format that suits a user.
            </p>
            <p>Another standard that I had implemented is the WCAG 2.0. The acronym of WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and the standards cover a variety of specifications for different forms of disability. One accessibility issue that it addresses is the need to text alternative for each non-text content like an audio or a video for computing device that cannot load the non-textual content which I had implemented in my Media webpage with a text alternative for each audio or video content to explain the object to users. Another specification is the need to ensure that color-blind users do not need to use the colors in the webpage for information. A third specification is the need to display color theme with high contrast and set the font to a certain size for users with vision impairment. There is also the specification for name, role, and value of webpage elements, but this is only for web authors who created their own user interface components as the standard HTML controls already satisfies this specification.
